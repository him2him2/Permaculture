## Rabbits Water Requirements
Rabbits like all animals need clear fresh water everyday. Rabbits are 50-75%  water and rabbits can not store extra water. New clean water is required to replace water lost through respiration, cooling and excretion of waste. Rabbits daily water requirements are affected by the following:

+ volume of feed
+ feed composition-<br/>
	High fiber and high protein diets will require more water.
+ Environmental temperatures-<br/>
	This is the biggest single factor governing water requirements. Rabbits can drink twice as much water on a hot day.
+ relative humidity-<br/>
	Arid conditions can lead to dehydration requiring more water.
+ animal size
+ animal activity level
+ reproductive phase (gestation or kindling)-<br/>
	Rabbits with litter require increased water intake

### Watering System Types
+ Automatic Waters
+ Nipple waterers
