## Cage Size
According to the Animal Welfare Act, the following weight ranges should be used to determine minimum space requirements for individually housed rabbits. [^JeffD]

| Weight | Pen Size |
| --- | --- |
| < 4.4 lbs	| 1.5 sq ft |
| 4.4–8.8 lbs | 3.0 sq ft |
| 8.8–11.9 lbs | 4.0 sq ft |
| > 11.9 lbs | 5.0 sq ft |

Cage height has a minimum requirement of 16" to allow room for rabbits to carry their ears erect without touching the top of the cage. [^JeffD]
